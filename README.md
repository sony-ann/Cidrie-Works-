#Face Detection 
This project demonstrates real-time face detection using a webcam and Haar Cascade Classifier in OpenCV.  
The program captures live video, detects human faces, and draws bounding boxes around them.

##How It Works
1.Webcam captures live video frames
2.Each frame is converted to grayscale
3.Haar Cascade detects faces in the frame
4.Rectangles are drawn around detected faces
5.Press 'Q' to exit the program
